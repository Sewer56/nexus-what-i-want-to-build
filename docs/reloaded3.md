# A Better Modding Framework

- **Status:** In Progress (Own Project)
- **Completion Date:** Maybe 2028, I've worked on this every hour of weekend since March 2023, and I'm only like 20% there.

A fully modular Modding Framework (mod loader + 1st party tooling) that gives you everything you need
to start modding any new game ***in the best way possible***; without compromises. That is the
[Reloaded3 Project](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-III/index.html).

The [Lossless Texture Compression](./dxt-lossless-transform.md) and [Nx2.0 Archive Format](./nx2.0.md)
projects are part of this larger ordeal. Likewise, some Reloaded3 research was also used to build parts of the
App, e.g. some GOG integration details.

!!! note "But I'll keep it short here."

    Unfortunately, at this point I've spent 4 full days straight writing this little web page. 

    If I were to write this page, it would be the longest page of them all, by a lot.
    If you're curious about any details, feel free to ask me about it.

## The Premise

!!! tip "Reloaded3 is a successor to my [Reloaded-II Modding Framework](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/)"

    Reloaded-II is a Modding Framework I independently (alone) developed between 2019 and 2023;
    with ~2 million unique downloads.

    It's used for around 30-40 games, hosting communities of various sizes and provides standardized
    features for modding games such as a Mod Loader, Libraries, Integrated Mod Manager and more.

    But, it's buried in limitations of its design and time; and I've been working hard on a successor.

!!! info "Modding is extremely unstandardized"

    Everyone does things a little bit differently, and there are no real standards.

    Mod framework authors (SMAPI, SKSE, SFSE, BLSE, BG3SE, etc.) have to reinvent the wheel, the world, and the universe
    with every game.

Not only is this a significant time investment for people who just want to mod games, but it's also
a massive maintenance burden on projects like the Nexus Mods App, which has to support all of these
different frameworks and their quirks on a per game basis.

The main goal of Reloaded3 is to provide a ***world class, modular, modding environment***, so
people would not have to keep reinventing the wheel every time.

I'll leave it at this for now ðŸ˜…, time for a rest.
