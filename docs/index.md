# What does Seweryn want to build?

!!! question "What would you build if you had a magic wand?"

    *Is what the Chosen Ones said.*

Having had a lot of thoughts for a long time, and never the proper time to compile them, I might just
take the time to list some of them here. ðŸ˜‰

This is my own wishlist, some of the items here are things I have already started working on
(alone, in my own time) and some are just ideas for the site itself that I think would be essential to have.

## Item Classification

!!! info "Each item is classified as the following"

| Status                 | Meaning                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unknown                | Unknown or not planned                                                                                |
| Shortlisted            | Internally noted (e.g. in Confluence) as possible future work item but work not yet planned or began. |
| Planned                | Company plans to do this in the future or the feature is in progress.                                 |

All classifications are to best of my knowledge at the time of writing.
For some of the projects, I'm already building them in my own time, every hour I can spare;
they are marked as the following:

| Status                 | Meaning                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In Progress (Weekends) | Working at this in my own time over weekends.                                                         |
| Planned (Weekends)     | Stuff I'll be working on in my own time.                                                              |
